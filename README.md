# Is there life after Lombok?

This repo contains the [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) slide-deck used for my conference talk "Is there life after Lombok?".

## Abstract
t’s 2010, the Ghostbusters theme song starts playing and two guys in matching outfits come on stage. 
They introduce themselves as the Boilerplate Busters. It’s the first time I hear about project Lombok. 
After the session my peers are full of excitement. I however don’t really feel it. 
Sure, it’s nice that there is less code to write and maintain, but these setters and getters were never really in my way. 
And it probably plays some dirty tricks as well...

I expected Lombok to be just a fad, but I couldn't be more wrong. 
Every single project I worked on after that day had at least some piece of Lombok. 
I decided to try to live with it, but it never gave me the warm fuzzy feeling that others apparently got from it. 
By now I've worked with it long enough to understand why I don't like it.
So, the time has come to tell the story of Java without Lombok.

In this session I will tell you why I think Lombok is not always a good idea. 
I'll show why some of the most popular features may seem to add value, but also bring some serious cost.
